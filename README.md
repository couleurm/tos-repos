Delicious list of useful stuff I don't talk about on [CTT](http://dsc.gg/CTT 'A discord server about video, optimizations and automation'). Anything in this repo should be used at your own risk/discretion, I just made this small repo to share what I don't care to verify is 100% safe to share on Discord.

Tweak Discord to your liking, not only can you have custom themes and plugins to help you, but also also to easily make small fixes to the gui in CSS.

### List of plugins I use:
* [View Raw](https://github.com/Juby210/view-raw) - equivalent to discord's "copy text", it lets you copy messages with raw formatting, as it was sent
* [VC Timer](https://github.com/RazerMoon/vcTimer) - Shows the time you've spent in call, I just use it because it makes a bigger button to click on.
* Better codeblocks (Included with Powercord) - Lets you copy the codeblocks people make, linecounts and see what language has been set to highlight.
* [Mute New Guilds](https://github.com/RazerMoon/muteNewGuild) - Mutes a server upon joining.

- Their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Powercord) / [website](https://powercord.dev)

Title is pretty obvious, just a batch script (that invokes rundll32 and does a bit of powershell) for playing Valorant stretched
